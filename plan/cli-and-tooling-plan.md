# CLI and Tooling Plan

## Purpose

Gelite needs a command-line interface that exercises the engine pipeline
without putting parsing, planning, SQL rendering, or SQLite execution logic in
the CLI crate itself.

The CLI should stay thin:

```text
read files / parse arguments
-> call engine crates
-> print diagnostics, plans, SQL, or query results
```

The same command implementation should be usable from a future REPL meta
command and from tests. The binary should not become the only place where
schema apply or query execution behavior exists.

## Command Shape

Use one top-level binary:

```text
gelite
```

Initial commands:

```text
gelite schema plan <schema.geli>
gelite schema apply <schema.geli> --database <app.db>

gelite query plan <query.geliql> --schema <schema.geli>
gelite query run <query.geliql> --database <app.db>

gelite repl --schema <schema.geli>
gelite repl --database <app.db>
```

`schema plan` and `schema apply` should be implemented before query execution
commands. A database cannot provide a real catalog until a schema has been
applied.

## CLI Parser

Use `clap` for the first CLI implementation.

`bpaf` is closer to Haskell `optparse-applicative` because it supports
combinator-style parser construction, but the Gelite CLI is not the core
learning target. The CLI should be conventional, well documented, and easy to
extend with nested subcommands. `clap` gives a stable derive-based model for
that:

```rust
#[derive(clap::Parser)]
struct Cli {
    #[command(subcommand)]
    command: Command,
}

#[derive(clap::Subcommand)]
enum Command {
    Schema {
        #[command(subcommand)]
        command: SchemaCommand,
    },
    Query {
        #[command(subcommand)]
        command: QueryCommand,
    },
    Repl(ReplArgs),
}
```

The CLI parser should produce typed command structs only. It should not parse
`.geli` or `.geliql` language content.

## Crate Boundary

The project should split command orchestration from the binary entrypoint.

Recommended layout:

```text
engine/crates/gelite-commands
tools/gelite-cli
tools/repl
```

`tools/gelite-cli` owns:

- `main`
- `clap` argument parsing
- process exit codes
- writing command output to stdout/stderr

`gelite-commands` owns:

- schema command orchestration
- query command orchestration
- formatting command output into stable structs or text
- shared command functions used by CLI and REPL meta commands

`gelite-commands` should depend on runner-facing traits, not on a concrete
SQLite binding. Native CLI setup can construct a native runner backend and pass
it to the command layer.

The existing `tools/repl` can remain while the new CLI is introduced. Once
`gelite repl` exists, `tools/repl` can either be replaced by the new binary or
turned into a thin wrapper around the same command/repl implementation.

## Schema Commands

### `gelite schema plan <schema.geli>`

Purpose: show what would be applied to an empty SQLite database.

Pipeline:

```text
read schema.geli
-> schema_parser::parse_schema
-> sqlite_schema_plan::plan_initial_schema
-> sqlite_schema_sqlgen::render_initial_schema
-> print SQL statements and bind values
```

This command must not open a database. It should work in environments where
SQLite execution is unavailable.

Output should keep SQL and bind values separate:

```text
CREATE TABLE user (...)

INSERT INTO _engine_catalog_objects (object_id, name) VALUES (?, ?)
  binds: [Integer(1), Text("User")]
```

Do not inline metadata text values into generated SQL output.

First command-level test:

```text
schema_plan_command_renders_initial_schema_from_source
```

Assert:

- `.geli` source is parsed
- metadata tables appear before object tables
- object metadata insert statements keep bind values
- planned indexes appear after table creation

### `gelite schema apply <schema.geli> --database <app.db>`

Purpose: apply the initial schema to an empty SQLite database.

Pipeline:

```text
read schema.geli
-> schema_parser::parse_schema
-> sqlite_schema_plan::plan_initial_schema
-> sqlite_schema_sqlgen::render_initial_schema
-> sqlite_runner::apply_schema_statements over a native runner backend
```

Initial scope:

- initial schema only
- empty or newly created database
- one transaction if the runner supports it
- no schema diffing
- no migration history row until checksum and snapshot rules exist

First command-level test:

```text
schema_apply_command_applies_initial_schema_to_database
```

Assert:

- database file or in-memory database is created
- metadata tables exist after apply
- object tables exist after apply
- catalog object rows exist after apply

Do not implement this command before `sqlite-runner` has tests for DDL,
prepared metadata inserts, and full rendered initial schema application.

## Query Commands

### `gelite query plan <query.geliql> --schema <schema.geli>`

Purpose: compile a query without executing it.

Pipeline:

```text
read schema.geli
-> schema_parser::parse_schema
read query.geliql
-> query_parser::parse_select
-> query_resolver::resolve_select
-> sqlite_query_plan::plan_select
-> sqlite_query_sqlgen::render_select
-> print SQL and bind values
```

This command should support `--debug` later. Without `--debug`, it should print
only final SQL and bind values. With `--debug`, it can print parsed query AST,
IR, SQLite plan, and rendered SQL.

This command does not need SQLite execution and can be added before
`query run`.

### `gelite query run <query.geliql> --database <app.db>`

Purpose: execute a query against a database that already has Gelite metadata.

Pipeline:

```text
read query.geliql
-> load schema_model::SchemaCatalog from SQLite metadata
-> query_parser::parse_select
-> query_resolver::resolve_select
-> sqlite_query_plan::plan_select
-> sqlite_query_sqlgen::render_select
-> sqlite_runner::execute_select
-> result shaping
-> print rows
```

Deferred dependencies:

- metadata-to-`SchemaCatalog` loading
- SELECT execution in `sqlite-runner`
- result shape reconstruction from flat rows

Do not add `query run` until those contracts are tested.

## REPL

The REPL is an interactive query workflow, not the primary migration or schema
application interface.

Initial modes:

```text
gelite repl --schema <schema.geli>
gelite repl --database <app.db>
```

`--schema` mode can compile/debug queries without executing them. `--database`
mode should load the catalog from metadata once catalog loading exists.

Allowed early meta commands:

```text
:help
:exit
:debug on
:debug off
:schema
```

Later schema meta commands may be added:

```text
:schema plan path/to/schema.geli
:schema apply path/to/schema.geli
```

Those commands must delegate to `gelite-commands`; they should not implement a
second schema planning or execution path inside the REPL.

## WASM and Browser Demo

The engine crates are being kept mostly `no_std`, and `sqlite-rs-embedded`
describes itself as `no_std` and WASM-compatible. That makes a browser demo
possible, but it should not change the first CLI/runtime sequence.

The intended browser demo stack is:

- Solid.js for the UI
- a WASM build of the Gelite engine crates
- a WASM-compatible SQLite runner backend implementing the same runner-facing
  contracts as the native backend
- Optique only where a TypeScript command parser is useful, such as a browser
  command palette, scripted demo commands, or a web-based CLI-like input

Optique is a type-safe combinatorial CLI parser for TypeScript. It should not
replace the Rust CLI parser used by `tools/gelite-cli`, and it should not own
Gelite language parsing. `.geli` and `.geliql` parsing must still come from the
Rust parser crates compiled to WASM.

The likely browser execution pipeline is:

```text
schema source in editor
-> schema_parser
-> sqlite_schema
-> sqlite_schema_sqlgen
-> sqlite_runner using a WASM backend
-> query_parser / resolver / sqlite_plan / sqlite_sqlgen
-> execute query in browser
-> render result rows
```

The first browser demo should be a developer tool, not a production server
replacement:

- in-browser schema editor
- query editor
- optional CLI-like command input for demos
- generated SQL view
- SQLite result preview
- optional debug panels for AST, IR, and SQLite plan

Do not start the browser demo until:

- `sqlite-runner` can apply an initial schema
- the native runner backend has proven the runner contract
- a WASM runner backend can open a database and execute the same smoke tests in
  the target browser/WASM environment
- SELECT execution and result shaping have tests outside the browser

The browser demo should reuse engine and command-layer code where possible.
Avoid putting language parsing or SQL generation logic in TypeScript.

## Implementation Sequence

1. Add `sqlite-runner` and define binding-neutral runner traits for DDL and
   metadata inserts.
2. Add `gelite-commands` with `schema plan` orchestration over source text.
3. Validate one native SQLite backend against the runner trait.
4. Add `tools/gelite-cli` using `clap`.
5. Implement `gelite schema plan`.
6. Implement `gelite schema apply`.
7. Add `query plan --schema`.
8. Add catalog loading from SQLite metadata.
9. Add SELECT execution to `sqlite-runner`.
10. Add `query run --database`.
11. Route `gelite repl` through the shared command/query implementation.
12. Validate a WASM runner backend against the same smoke tests.
13. Revisit WASM/browser demo once runner behavior is tested outside the
    browser.

## Current Non-Goals

- full migration diffing
- applying schema changes to non-empty databases
- query execution before catalog loading exists
- TypeScript reimplementation of Gelite parsers or planners
- browser demo before the SQLite runner contract is stable
